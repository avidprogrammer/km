Let A and B be two N bit numbers (MSB to the left). You are given initial values for A and B, and you should write a program which processes three kinds of queries:

set_a idx x: Set A[idx] to x, where 0 <= idx < N, where A[idx] is idxâ€™th least significant bit of A.
set_b idx x: Set B[idx] to x, where 0 <= idx < N.
get_c idx: Print C[idx], where C=A+B, and 0<=idx<N+1.
Input Format

First line of input contains two integers N and Q consecutively (1 <= N <= 100000, 1<= Q <= 500000). Second line is an N-bit binary number which denotes initial value of A, and the third line is an N-bit binary number denoting initial value of B. Q lines follow, each containing a query as described above.

Output Format

For each query of the type get_c, output a single digit 0 or 1. Output must be placed in a single line.

Sample Input

5 5  
00000  
11111  
set_a 0 1  
get_c 5  
get_c 1  
set_b 2 0  
get_c 5
Sample Output

100  
Explanation

set_a 0 1 sets 00000 to 00001
C = A + B = 00001 + 11111 = 100000, so get_c[5] = 1
from the above computation get_c[1] = 0
set_b 2 0 sets 11111 to 11011
C = A + B = 00001 + 11011 = 011110, so get_c[5] = 0
The output is hence concatenation of 1, 0 and 0 = 100
